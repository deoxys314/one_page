## Introduction

You've been asked to consult about a park which has, through the wonder of genetic power, resurrected extinct animals. This morning, things looked good. But right now, it's getting dark, there's a rain that's threatening to turn into a storm, and you're separated from the main group.

Also, something just made a noise in the distance, and you think it's coming for you.

## Character Creation

Choose a **name**, some **pronouns**, a **look**, a **want** (some goal you are working towards in life (besides getting off this island)) and a **skill** (some way you have of obtaining that goal (besides fleeing any way you can)).

## Gameplay

Each player should generate a character. Then, using the scenario generator below, or your own imagination, someone should describe where on the island your characters are and what situation they're in.

Go around and narrate how your characters respond to the situation. There's no turn order - if you notice you've done a lot lately, stay quiet for a bit. If you notice another player has done a lot lately, look for an opportunity to jump in.

When you narrate your character doing something that may or may not work, you should **test** yourself to see if it succeeds.

## Testing your skills

When you come across some obstacle, think about how hard it will be. Choose a **difficulty** based on the table below:

**Difficulty** | Example                                                                                     | **Target**
----           | ----------                                                                                  | :--:
Passe          | recalling recent details about your life                                                    | 2
Risky          | climbing a flight of stairs with a crate in your hands                                      | 4
Dangerous      | navigating a conversation with an ex-spouse                                                 | 6
Desperate      | utilizing an unfamiliar UNIX system while a large predator is trying to break into the room | 8
Superhuman     | jump a chasm as the rope bridge falls out from under you                                    | 10
Impossible     | convince a *Utahraptor* pack to aid you in your goals                                       | 12

*Note: You are on an island surrounded by the results of unfettered genetic tinkering. Most things are going to be **dangerous**, or worse!*

Then, roll a **d8**. If you're using your skill, **add 2**. If someone else is helping you, **add 2**. If you have suffered some sort of harm or are impeded by another character or creature, **subtract 2**. The final total is your **result**.

If your **result** is higher than or equal to the **target**, you succeed at the task. Great job! Briefly narrate how you overcome this obstacle.

If your **result** is lower than the **target**, you have failed. Another player should briefly narrate how you or another character are harmed by this, or how the group is set back by this.

In either case (success or failure), the situation has changed as a result of you taking action. You or another player should continue to narrate the scene.

## Scenario Generator

Roll for or choose for each of the branching paths.

> Earlier today, you left from the **[ hotel / bungalow / office park / mainland ]** to tour the island. You passed by the **[ *Triceratops* / *trilobite* / *Dicynodont* / *Arthropleura* ]** exhibit without incident, but then at the **[ River Cruise / mid-tour meatball bar / *Allosaurus* paddock / (poorly-named) Aviary]**, one of your group left the **[ boat / Land Rovers / train car / walking tour ]** to investigate a/an **[ strange noise / eggshell / injured animal / anachronistic flower ]**. Soon after, you decided to split up, allowing you to continue the tour. But then, **[ you found out some of the creatures are on a boat to the mainland / you were betrayed by someone in the group employed by a rival company / you realized you left your camera in your room / all the fences failed ]**.
